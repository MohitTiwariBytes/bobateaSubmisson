      <span>Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, tapioca milk tea, boba tea, or boba; Chinese:
        珍珠奶茶; pinyin: zhēnzhū nǎichá, 波霸奶茶; bōbà nǎichá) is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early
        1980s.[1][2] Taiwanese immigrants brought it to the United States in the 1990s, initially in California through
        regions including Los Angeles County,[3] but the drink has also spread to other countries where there is a large
        East Asian diaspora population.</span>
